## **Java for beginners**
That's a repository for learning purposes, specially Java programing. 
I'm just trying to learn more about programing and Github. 

### Github 
Things I've learn to do in Github:
- First of all, I've edited `README` and made commits. 
- Secondly, I've uploaded my java code.
- Third, I've merged complementary java code.

### Java 
Different things I've learn about Java:
- Data types for numbers : short, byte, int, long, float and double. 
- Other data types: boolean and char.
- Casting or changing the type of data
- Create arrays of different dimensions and print them.
